# Mask-based local adjustments (subject / background)

## Motivation

Vireo already knows where the bird is — MegaDetector boxes prompt SAM masks
that exist for most keeper photos. No generic editor has that. Local
adjustments turn it into the editor's differentiating feature: brighten and
sharpen the subject, quiet down the background, one slider each, no manual
brushing.

## What exists (facts the design builds on)

- `photo_masks`: one row per (photo, variant); PNG single-channel masks
  (0/255) on disk at `~/.vireo/masks/{photo_id}.{variant}.png`, generated at
  working resolution in the **orientation-corrected working image space**
  — the pixel space of `image_loader.load_image` / `render_proxy` output,
  which applies `ImageOps.exif_transpose` (both standard images and RAW
  postprocess), before any recipe geometry (rotation/flip/straighten/crop)
  is applied. The prompt detection box is stored per mask;
  `photos.active_mask_variant` picks the live one.
- RAW files have **two** decode modes with potentially different pixel
  dimensions and aspect ratios: `RAW_DECODE_JPEG_FIRST` (default —
  embedded camera JPEG when it satisfies the requested size) and
  `RAW_DECODE_PRESERVE_HIGHLIGHTS` (libraw demosaic with auto-bright off,
  used by every edit-quality path — thumbnails, previews, exports — see
  `image_loader.py:19` and `export.py:303`). Detection and mask
  extraction (`detector.py:330`, `masking.py:498`) go through the default
  `load_image`, so today's `photo_masks` for RAWs are typically in
  JPEG-first space; edit-render sources for the same photos are in
  preserve-highlights space. On RAWs where the embedded JPEG differs from
  the demosaiced output (different long-edge size, cropped-to-16:9
  companion, etc.) the two spaces do not agree pixel-for-pixel.
- Masks regenerate when the detection prompt changes and can be deleted by
  storage cleanup (`delete_stale_masks`, variant deletion). Detection IDs are
  not stable across detector re-runs.
- The lightbox mask overlay currently hides itself when a recipe has
  geometry because the raw mask no longer lines up — a display-layer
  workaround this feature replaces with a real transform.
- The tone pipeline (`tone.py`) is strictly per-pixel; the detail pass
  (`detail.py`) is neighborhood-based, runs last at output resolution with
  scale-adjusted kernels.

## Design

### Recipe schema

New optional `local` section — a single object carrying the shared mask
reference plus an array of region entries (v1 supports at most one `subject`
and one `background` entry):

```json
"local": {
  "mask": {"ref": "a1b2c3d4", "feather": 12.0},
  "regions": [
    {
      "region": "subject",
      "adjustments": {"exposure": 0.6, "shadows": 25, "sharpen": 30}
    },
    {
      "region": "background",
      "adjustments": {"exposure": -0.4, "saturation": -15, "noise_reduction": 40}
    }
  ]
}
```

- The mask reference lives at `local.mask`, not per region — subject and
  background always share one snapshot (background is its inverse), and
  hoisting the ref means a **background-only** recipe still records the
  snapshot needed for deterministic renders, stale-mask comparison, and
  snapshot GC (no fall-through to the live active mask). Feather is a
  Gaussian softening radius in **native pixels**, scaled at render time like
  detail kernels.
- `local` is dropped from normalization entirely when `regions` is empty or
  every region normalizes away — the shared `mask` never persists without at
  least one active region referencing it.
- Allowed per-region adjustments (v1): `exposure`, `highlights`, `shadows`,
  `contrast`, `saturation`, plus detail's `sharpen`/`sharpen_radius`/
  `noise_reduction`. Same ranges and normalization rules as global
  adjustments; zero values normalize away, empty entries are dropped.

### Mask snapshots, not live references

The recipe's `local.mask.ref` points to a **content-addressed snapshot**
copied to `<db_dir>/edit-masks/{photo_id}.{sha1[:12]}.png` at the moment the
first local adjustment is added — where `<db_dir>` is `dirname(--db)`, the
same root as the existing `<db_dir>/masks/` store. Vireo supports arbitrary
`--db` paths, so a global `~/.vireo/edit-masks/` keyed only on `photo_id`
would collide across separate databases (tests, alternate libraries) and
let one database's snapshot GC delete another's referenced snapshots.

**Snapshot space matches the edit-render source.** For non-RAWs the
existing `photo_masks` file is already in edit-render space and is copied
as-is. For RAWs the snapshot must be aligned with the edit path's decode
(RAW_DECODE_PRESERVE_HIGHLIGHTS at working resolution). Cheapest path
that's guaranteed to align: at snapshot time, re-run the mask's stored
detection box through the SAM pass on a `load_image(..., raw_decode=
RAW_DECODE_PRESERVE_HIGHLIGHTS)` load and write the result as the
snapshot. That trades a few seconds of one-time work for a snapshot that
is by construction the same pixel space (dimensions, aspect, orientation)
as every subsequent edit render — no runtime rescale, no per-recipe
alignment metadata to keep in sync with future decode changes. The
snapshot's stored width/height are also recorded in the recipe (as a
sanity check the weight-map builder can verify against the loaded edit
source; a mismatch disables the local pass with a warning, same failure
mode as a missing snapshot). Because a snapshot is created at most once
per (photo, mask content) and reused across every future edit render for
that recipe, this cost is amortized to zero.

Why not reference the live active mask: renders must stay a deterministic
function of (source pixels, recipe). Preview/thumbnail caches invalidate on
recipe change and `EDIT_MATH_VERSION` bumps only — a mask silently
regenerating under a live reference would change render output with no cache
invalidation and no user-visible cause, violating the no-black-boxes rule.

Staleness is surfaced, not automated: when `photos.active_mask_variant`'s
mask content differs from the snapshot, the editor shows "Newer subject mask
available — Update" and updating rewrites `local.mask.ref` (a normal recipe
edit: undoable, cache-invalidating). If the snapshot file is missing, the
renderer **disables the whole local pass** for that photo — both subject
*and* background weights held at zero, so no region's adjustments apply —
and the editor shows a warning. (A no-op / all-zero subject mask would leave
background weight = `1 − 0` = 1 everywhere, silently applying background
edits to the entire frame; disabling both regions keeps missing snapshots
from turning into a whole-photo edit.)

Snapshot lifecycle: created on first use, garbage-collected when no recipe
(current or in edit history) references them — same sweep style as other
storage cleanups, surfaced in `/api/storage`.

### Rendering

Order stays geometry → tone → resize → detail, with local weights woven in.
Tone runs at pre-resize working-image dimensions inside `apply_recipe`, then
`apply_recipe_to_loaded_image` calls `thumbnail(max_size)`, then detail runs
at the post-resize render size — so a single weight map cannot serve both
passes. The weight map is built once and materialized at both scales:

1. **Weight map.** Load the snapshot mask and apply the recipe's geometry
   (rotation/flip/straighten/crop — same transforms as the image, bilinear).
   From that geometry-transformed mask, materialize two aligned copies with
   feather applied at each target scale (Gaussian radius scaled the same way
   as detail kernels), normalize to [0,1]:
   - **Tone weight** — sized to the pre-resize working image, consumed by
     the tone pass inside `apply_recipe`.
   - **Detail weight** — sized to the post-`thumbnail` render size, consumed
     by the detail pass.

   Background weight = 1 − subject weight, computed independently at each
   scale so tone and detail each see aligned subject/background pairs.
2. **Local tone** runs inside the existing tone pass with per-pixel strength:
   e.g. exposure becomes `lin * 2^(ev_global + ev_subject·w + ev_bg·(1−w))`;
   range/saturation controls interpolate their amounts by `w` the same way.
   This keeps every op per-pixel — it adds a weight *input*, not a
   neighborhood — so the WebGL live preview can adopt it later by sampling
   the mask as a second texture (out of scope for v1; the lightbox preview
   approximates and snaps to the server render, as it already does for
   detail and re-edits).
3. **Local detail** runs the existing detail pass **twice** on the
   pre-detail image — once with the **subject branch** parameters, once
   with the **background branch** — and blends the two outputs by the
   detail weight map: `out = subject_out · w + background_out · (1 − w)`.
   Each branch's parameters are `global + region_delta` per field:
   `sharpen = global.sharpen + subject.sharpen`, `noise_reduction =
   global.noise_reduction + subject.noise_reduction`, and the same for
   background — mirroring the tone contract (`ev_global + ev_subject·w
   + ev_bg·(1−w)`) so local sliders read as deltas on top of the
   whole-photo baseline. `sharpen_radius` prefers the region's value when
   set, else falls back to the global (radius is a kernel size, not a
   strength, so add-on semantics don't apply). All resulting scalars pass
   through the same clamp/range as normal global detail. When the recipe
   has **no** `local` block or every region normalizes away, the
   whole-photo detail pass runs exactly as today (byte-identical — that's
   what keeps `EDIT_MATH_VERSION` unbumped). A single pass with combined
   scalars cannot represent both regions when `local` is present:
   `_run_detail` in `detail.py` applies NR to `out` before sharpen reads
   it, so subject-sharpen + background-NR would noise-reduce the subject
   before its sharpen delta (or drop one region's setting). Optimization:
   if both branches resolve to identical scalars (e.g., both regions have
   zero deltas, or one region's zeros produce the same `global +
   delta` as the other's), one pass runs and its output is used for both
   sides of the blend — the blend then simplifies to that single output,
   matching the global-only path.

No `EDIT_MATH_VERSION` bump: recipes without `local` render byte-identically.

### Editor UI

- Two new bands, **Subject** and **Background**, shown only when the photo
  has a usable mask; otherwise one honest line ("No subject mask — run the
  pipeline's mask stage") instead of dead sliders.
- Each band: its allowed sliders + a shared **Feather** slider on the
  Subject band. A small overlay toggle on the preview shows exactly which
  pixels count as subject — the transparency rule applied to masks — but
  served from a **new** `/api/local-mask/<pid>/preview.png` endpoint that
  returns the recipe's weight map (snapshot at `local.mask.ref` → recipe
  geometry → feather → preview size), the same uncropped weight map used
  by the editor preview (see §Editor preview). Reusing the existing
  `/api/masks/<pid>/<variant>.png` would serve the live
  `photo_masks.path` unchanged, so the overlay would disagree with the
  saved edit exactly when the recipe has rotation, crop, feather, or a
  stale active mask — the cases this feature exists to fix.
- Stale-snapshot banner with an explicit Update action as above.
- Copy Settings / presets: local adjustments are **not** included in presets
  (they reference a photo-specific mask); Copy Settings to a group copies
  the local slider values and re-snapshots each target photo's own active
  mask, skipping (and reporting) photos without one.

### Editor preview

The editor's server renders pick up local adjustments automatically (they
render the full recipe). The uncropped editor preview uses the
geometry-transformed-but-uncropped weight map, consistent with how crop is
previewed today.

## Phasing

1. **PR 1 — renderer + schema.** `local` normalization, mask snapshot
   plumbing + GC, weight-map builder, weighted tone + detail, API round-trip.
   Fully testable without UI (synthetic masks in tests).
2. **PR 2 — editor UI.** Subject/Background bands, feather, overlay toggle,
   stale-mask update flow, copy-to-group behavior.
3. **PR 3 (optional) — live preview.** Mask texture in the lightbox WebGL
   shader for instant local-tone feedback.

## Open questions (decide during PR 1)

- Feather default: start at ~2% of the long edge, clamp to [0, 60px] native?
- Should `background` NR default on softly when the subject is sharp and the
  background is high-ISO mush? (Tempting, but silent defaults fight the
  transparency rule — v1 says no.)
- Mask resolution: snapshots are working-resolution; is bilinear upscale to
  full-res export acceptable at feather radii we allow? (Expected yes — the
  feather blur dominates interpolation error.)
