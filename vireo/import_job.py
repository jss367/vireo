"""Import job: copy card -> archive directly, hash-verify, catalog incrementally.

Implements the import half of the import/process split (design doc
2026-07-04-import-process-split-design.md). The core invariant:

    A photo row is created only when its file verifiably exists at its
    final archive path.

Files are copied per destination-folder batch, each copy is verified by
content hash before promotion, and each batch is cataloged via the
scanner's restricted-scan path immediately after it lands. A run that
dies at any point leaves a valid partial catalog; a retry's duplicate
gate skips exactly the files that landed and copies the rest. There is
no staging tree and no unwind step (`_deindex_staging` has no
equivalent here).

Reconnaissance notes (Task 2.0, verified 2026-07-04):

1. ``scanner.scan()`` computes and writes ``photos.file_hash`` itself
   (``_compute_file_features`` hashes every new/changed file). It does
   NOT write ``hash_status``/``hash_checked_at`` — those belong to the
   integrity-audit vocabulary, so the import job stamps them after each
   batch's scan, gated on the scan-computed hash matching the hash this
   job verified at copy time (a free cross-check: a mismatch means the
   destination changed between copy and scan and the file is bucketed
   as failed instead of silently trusted).
2. ``CatalogIndex`` retains only identity sets (hashes/keys/sizes), not
   paths. Key-match twin resolution for the safe-to-format ledger uses
   a direct DB query on (filename, file_size) + stored_metadata_key
   equality, joining folders for the archive path.
3. Cancellation mirrors the scan job: the work function polls
   ``runner.is_cancelled(job_id)`` at batch boundaries and passes
   ``cancel_check`` into ``scan()``; the runner flips the job status to
   "cancelled" when the work function returns after a Stop.
4. Batch unit: files grouped by destination (template) folder,
   processed in template order, chunked to at most
   ``IMPORT_BATCH_SIZE`` files per scan call. Restricted scans only
   enumerate the restricted dirs, so per-batch scan cost tracks the
   batch, not the archive tree. One deliberate deviation from the plan
   text: duplicate-matched folders are scanned in a SEPARATE
   ``scan(restrict_dirs=…)`` call without ``restrict_files`` —
   ``_ensure_folder`` only fires for *discovered* files, so folding
   duplicate dirs into the fresh-copy call (whose ``restrict_files``
   excludes their files) would create/link nothing for duplicate-only
   imports.

    The copy goes to a hidden sibling temp path first; only a copy whose

    left untouched.
